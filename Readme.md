## Introduction
The Sudoku Solver is built using advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. It can accurately detect and extract the Sudoku grid from an image, and then solve the puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.

## Installation
To install and run the Sudoku Solver, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/sudoku-solver.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the solver: `python solver.py`

## Usage
To use the Sudoku Solver, simply provide an image of an unsolved Sudoku puzzle as input. The solver will process the image and display the solved solution.

```python
from solver import solve_sudoku

image_path = "path/to/unsolved_sudoku.jpg"
solution = solve_sudoku(image_path)

print(solution)
```
